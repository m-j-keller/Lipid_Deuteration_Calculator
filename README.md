This code is an example of the fitting approached used in the publication "Characterization of the In Vivo Deuteration of Native Phospholipids by Mass Spectrometry Yields Guidelines for Their Regiospecific Customization" published at Analytical Chemistry (doi: https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03750). This is used to fit a percent deuteration of a given lipid to an observed isotope distribution. The result will be a deuterium probability that describes the probability for any given hydrogen to be deuterium. Specific questions can be posted on github or by contacting me directly at qrh579@vols.utk.edu.
